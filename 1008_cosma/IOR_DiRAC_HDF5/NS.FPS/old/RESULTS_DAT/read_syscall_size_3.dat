# This data file contains the size of the read syscalls 
#   versus time for a specific file. 
# The x axis data is time relative to the beginning of the run 
#   where 0 is the start of the run. 
# The y axis data is the number of bytes for each read syscall 
#   for the specific file (in bytes). 
# 
# File: ./test.sh 
# 
# It is best to plot this data as a scatter chart with no lines 
#   connecting the data points.
