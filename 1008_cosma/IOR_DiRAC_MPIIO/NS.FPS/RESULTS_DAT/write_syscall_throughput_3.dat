# This data file contains the throughput in MB/s of each write syscall 
#   call versus time for a specific file. 
# The x axis data is time relative to the beginning of the run 
#   where 0 is the start of the run. 
# The y axis data is the throughput in MB/s for each write syscall  
#   for each file. 
# 
# File: ./test.sh 
# 
# It is best to plot this data as a scatter chart with no lines 
#   connecting the data points.
