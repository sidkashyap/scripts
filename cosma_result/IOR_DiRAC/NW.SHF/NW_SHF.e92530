Your job has requested a conflicting number of processes for the
application:

App: /scratch/dr002/shared/DiRAC3-testsuite/bin/ior
number of procs:  128

This is more processes than we can launch under the following
additional directives and conditions:

number of nodes:   32
npernode:   1

Please revise the conflict and try again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A daemon (pid unknown) died unexpectedly on signal 1  while attempting to
launch so we are aborting.

There may be more information reported by the environment (see above).

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared
libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.
