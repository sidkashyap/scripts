		-intra=shm|nic|mix
		                    Specifies what communication method to

		                    inter-host transfers to be used for intra-
		                    host transfers.  On some systems and some

		                    bandwidth.  The third setting (mix) causes

		                    messages.
		                    will be the best setting, nic is only

		-sp <paths>         Use <paths> to locate executables.
		-mpi32 | mpi64      Used to indicate application bitness.
